        <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
        <p>We will use the concept of persistence of vision to create an image with a high-speed fan. The fan will track
            where the user is looking from and update the angle it is facing as well as the displayed image so that a 3D
            hologram is shown. In the case of multiple users around the fan, a fiducial could be worn by the user that
            the fan should be focusing on. This could be used for advertising, decoration, or as an alternative for VR.
            Once a static object can successfully be displayed, the project could be extended to 3D animations.</p>

            <li>Learn how rotary displays function. Then implement for our needs.</li>
            <li>Try several engines such as Unreal, Unity, Blender, OpenGl, etc. and evaluate output quality and timing.
            </li>
            <li>Test and learn frameworks for computer vision.</li>

                <p>Brandon Chen is starting his third year studying Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
                    After completing the general education and pre requisite courses, he is now focusing on the upper
                    division courses to graduate. Having the ability to adapt quickly while being resilient has helped
                    him achieve success through college. He has also been a member of the University of Utah Menâ€™s Club
                    Soccer team for all three years. Balancing academics with soccer, Brandon likes to spend the rest of
                    his free time enjoying nature with different types of outdoor activities.

                <p>Emmanuel Lotubai is in his fourth year studying Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
                    He is expecting to graduate with a BS degree in fall of 2021. In his career, Emmanuel has focused on
                    software development.
                    In this project, he hopes to improve his hardware understanding by working closely with his team.
                    Emmanuel's life long goal is
                    to use the skills he acquires to help people.
