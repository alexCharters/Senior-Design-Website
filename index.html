        <h2>Project Abstract</h2>
        <p>We will use the concept of persistence of vision to create an image with a high-speed fan. The fan will track
            where the user is looking from and update the angle it is facing as well as the displayed image so that a 3D
            hologram is shown. This used for advertising, decoration, or as an alternative for VR. Once a static object
            can successfully be displayed, the project could be extended to 3D animations.</p>

        <h2>Challenges</h2>
        <h3>Software Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Must develop scanline algorithm for rotary display</li>
            <li>Must determine how to interface with game engine or computer graphics software</li>
            <li>Must implement computer vision</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Harware Challenges</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Must precisely control speed and position for both motors controlling fan direction and spin</li>
            <li>Need to source Slip Ring for providing electrical connections to spinning parts</li>
            <li>Must use a sufficiently fast controller for writing to LED's</li>
        </ul>
    </div>
    <div class="section">
        <h2>Proposed Methods</h2>
        <h3>Software Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Learn how rotary displays function. Then implement for our needs.</li>
            <li>Try several engines such as Unreal, Unity, Blender, OpenGl, etc. and evaluate output quality and timing.
            </li>
            <li>Test and learn frameworks for computer vision.</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Hardware Solutions</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Source controllers that are over-specced for the timing requirements.</li>
            <li>Source a slip ring that can handle the need RPM (may need to be chemical, rather than brushed)</li>
            <li>Use a raspberry Pi 4</li>
        </ul>

                <h3>Electrical</h3>
                <p>Brandon Chen is starting his third year studying Computer Engineering at the University of Utah.
                    After completing the general education and pre requisite courses, he is now focusing on the upper
                    division courses to graduate. Having the ability to adapt quickly while being resilient has helped
                    him achieve success through college. He has also been a member of the University of Utah Menâ€™s Club
                    Soccer team for all three years. Balancing academics with soccer, Brandon likes to spend the rest of
                    his free time enjoying nature with different types of outdoor activities.
